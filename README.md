# VehicleAPI

In this project, the 'Vehicle' class is a base class that contains common properties and behaviors for all other vehicle types. The 'Vehicle' class defines common properties such as Id, Color, ModelYear, and FuelType. The 'Car', 'Bus', 'Boat', and 'Plane' classes are derived from the 'Vehicle' class. These derived classes inherit the properties of the 'Vehicle' class and extend them. The 'Car' class includes additional features specific to its type, such as the 'HeadlightsOn' and 'Wheels' properties.
